# Pokeshop

This project is a continuation of the Odin Project. It's the final assignment in the React section. I chose to use my favorite franchise — Pokémon — to create the online Pokéshop, while keeping a retro video game style that reflects my personal touch.

The key skills demonstrated in this project include:

- Managing hooks (useState, useEffect)
- Making API calls

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [Project: Shopping Cart](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-shopping-cart) for the details of the project.
- [PokéAPI](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-shopping-cart) is the API i used to get all items information.
